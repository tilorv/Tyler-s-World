            <ul>
                <li>If you can keep your head when all about you</li>
                <li>    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</li>
                <li>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</li>
                <li>But make allowance for their doubting too;</li>
                <li>    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</li>
                <li>Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</li>
                <li>Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,</li>
                <li> And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</li>
                <p>
                   
                </p>
                <li>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;</li>
                <li>If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</li>
                <li>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster</li>
                <li>And treat those two impostors just the same;</li>
                <li>If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken</li>
                <li>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</li>
                <li>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,</li>
                <li>And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</li>
                <p>
            
                </p>
                <li>If you can make one heap of all your winnings</li>
                <li>    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</li>
                <li>And lose, and start again at your beginnings</li>
                <li>    And never breathe a word about your loss;</li>
                <li>    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</li>
                <li>To serve your turn long after they are gone,</li>
                <li>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</li>
                <li>Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</li>
                <p>

                </p>
                <li>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</li>
                <li>Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,</li>
                <li>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</li>
                <li>If all men count with you, but none too much;</li>
                <li>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</li>
                <li>With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,</li>
                <li>Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,</li>
                <li>And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</li>
